# Callum is wrong

This page is dedicated towards ridding callum of his racism, here are some of his views debunked 

## white ppl aren't very racist
>“Whites *by far* have the least in group out group bias”

##

## Obama
> "The fact is, race relations were really pretty good before Obama started going on about system racism and we had blm and stuff"
- test1
- test2

## BLM
> "The fact is, race relations were really pretty good before Obama started going on about system racism and we had blm and stuff"


## Genetic componenet of IQ gap between races
>I think a similar reason to you in that I think the arguments for a social explanation have little substance logically speaking (racism = lower IQ, why? Seems mainly to be an emotional response) and whilst the data is far from conclusive, when looking at the fact that richer black people have similar iq to poorer whites and that the racial iq gap has not significantly changed, I don't see reasons to believe it's societal

>I think it's the simpler, less convoluted explanation and that it would be more appealing if people didn't have to tread so carefully on this topic

## Asian work ethic ≠ reason for high IQ scores
>I would argue in this case it's because of their incredibly strong work ethic/culture around work, especially at school- and I don't see that as an unfair stereotype, as Daniel, who has lived in east asia, would testify it is true. It is not hard to see how this would increse IQ - Henry (who is correct)

>I also question the extent to which IQ can be increased this way - Callum
