# Callum🥕, we need to talk

I'm genuinely concerned  
Here are some of your opinons, debunked

> [!CAUTION]
> - No offence, but remember that you have no experience with racism
> - This clearly does not put you in the best position to discuss this topic - for whilst you ofc can discuss it freely, you just lack any _personal_ experience (which counts for something imo)



## 1. Institutional racism doesn't exist 
> "The fact is, race relations were really pretty good before Obama started going on about system racism and we had blm and stuff"  

Really?, _really_?, __*really*__??  
You really believe this **crap**???   

By _"system racism"_ i assume you mean systematic/institutional racism - how on earth is it a bad thing to bring institutional racism into the limelight?  

### ...so you think institutional racism doesn't exist?  
Rather than list of reasons why you are absolutely and utterly stupid, I think it'll more constructive to convince you that it does.
lets first take a look at a definition:

>#### institutional racism  
>noun  
>UK  /ˌɪn.stɪˌtʃuː.ʃən.əl ˈreɪ.sɪ.zəm/ US  /ˌɪn.stəˌtuː.ʃən.əl ˈreɪ.sɪ.zəm/  
>policies, rules, practices, etc. that are a usual part of the way an organization works, and that result in and support a continued unfair advantage to some people and unfair or harmful treatment of others based on race  [^1]

Seems simple enough. Any org. in which one race (e.g. whites) have an unfair advantage over another (e.g. blacks) counts as posessing institutional racism.

#### what institutional racism does NOT mean:
- only a white's problem
- that everyone in the institution is racist
- that _anyone_ in the institution is openly or otherwise consciously racist

Lets explore some org.s that fit that definition...

### Evidence for systematic racism in the Met police
The last independent review of the Met Police's internal culture stated[^2]:
1. Clearly not everyone in the Met is racist, but there are racists and people with racist attitudes within the organisation
2. Black and ethnic minority officers and staff experience racism at work and it is routinely ignored, dismissed, or not spoken about. Many do not think it is worth reporting
3. Racism and racial bias are reinforced within Met systems
4. The Met under-protects and over-polices Black Londoners  
> "We have found institutional racism, misogyny and homophobia in the Met." - Baroness Casey of blahblah 

_😬 pretty damming huh?_

ik that you will maybe not-believe this report, despite it being written by someone who _knowsMoreThanYou<sup>TM</sup>_, so here are some more examples:
- murder of stephen lawrence (the key report of which only came out only 10 yrs before obama took office)[^3]
- murder of Jean Charles de Menezes (brazillian) in 2005 (only 4 years before obama took office)[^3]
- 2019 child strip search statistics[^3]
  -  75% of strip searches from ethinically diverse backgrounds
  -  *75%* is **NOT** acceptable, whatever you may say about black crime
  -  Is it not horrifying that (based of ethnicicty) I am 3/4s more likely to be strip searched than you?
- murder of Chris Kaba (a black man shot by the police in **2022**)[^3]
  - and yet this kinda thing is a "thing of the past???"
  - this isn't even going into american politics, this happend a **fucking** **30 mile drive away from us**, is that not in the least concerning?
- during the pandemic black ppl were **217% as likely** as white ppl to be issued a fine for lockdown breaches? [^3]
  - this statistic holds up even when adjusted for neighbourhood composition
- within the police, black officeres describe being treated _"like animals"_ and that the racism was **getting worse** [^4]
  - so much for things are always much better rn eh?

### UK Prisons
- if you're not white and commit a crime, it is a fact that you are more likely to go to jail than if you were
  - 50% of youth immates are minorities [^5]
    - **%50 percent**, i doubt 50% of crimes are committed by minorities given we make up 14% of the population
    - how is this not insititutional racism???
    
### UK Healthcare
- Asian women are 2x as likely to die in pregnancy [^5]
- Black women are 2x as likely to have a stillborn baby than white women [^5]
How on earth is that acceptable
Yes there are physical differences between races in terms of the ease of pregancy, but:
a) not enough to account for a fucking 2x increase.
b) even if there were significant differences, doctors in the uk should learn better how to treat different races,
  - this IS possible given other countries where uk minorities are the majority have similar success rates to the uk

### In the education system
yes the *goddam education ssytem*, the **last place we want racism**
- is it not _slightly_ sobering that black students are far more likely to recieve **under predicted grades** by their teachers [^5]
- is this not the **ultimate** damming evidence of institutional racism???,  
i mean jesus christ if black kids are given a 2nd class education from the start, how tf can we expect them to perform equally as adults on shit like IQ tests?

### Income inequality
- If you're black and you have the same degree as a white person, you will on average end up with 27.1% less income
- **How** is that not evidence for prevelant institutional racism?
  - ‼️maybe allah isn't all that akbar after all eh‼️

## 2. White ppl aren't very racist 🥴
>“Whites *by far* have the least in group out group bias”


## 3. BLM bad bc riots or smthn
> "The fact is, race relations were really pretty good before Obama started going on about system racism and we had blm and stuff"


## 4. Black ppl genetically dumber
>I think a similar reason to you in that I think the arguments for a social explanation have little substance logically speaking (racism = lower IQ, why? Seems mainly to be an emotional response) and whilst the data is far from conclusive, when looking at the fact that richer black people have similar iq to poorer whites and that the racial iq gap has not significantly changed, I don't see reasons to believe it's societal
>
>...I think it's [genetics] the simpler, less convoluted explanation and that it would be more appealing if people didn't have to tread so carefully on this topic

>Fine, jfc, I'll just agree that I think it's more likely than not it [genetics] significantly explains it [IQ gap between races]

## 5. Asian work ethic ≠ reason for high IQ scores
>I would argue in this case it's because of their incredibly strong work ethic/culture around work, especially at school- and I don't see that as an unfair stereotype, as Daniel, who has lived in east asia, would testify it is true. It is not hard to see how this would increse IQ - Henry (who is correct)
>
>I also question the extent to which IQ can be increased this way - Callum
