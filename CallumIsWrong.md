# Callumü•ï, we need to talk

I'm genuinely concerned, **please, please, please read this!!!**  


> ### ‚ö†Ô∏è  Important:
> - No offence, but remember that you have no personal experience with racism

Here are some of your opinons, debunked...

<details>
<summary> Opinion 1: <h2>Institutional racism... </h2></summary>

> "The fact is, race relations were really pretty good before Obama started going on about system racism and we had blm and stuff"  

Really?, _really_?, __*really*__??  
You really believe this **crap**???   

By _"system racism"_ i assume you mean systematic/institutional racism - how on earth is it a bad thing to bring institutional racism into the limelight??  

### ...so you think institutional racism doesn't exist?  
Rather than list of reasons why you are absolutely and utterly stupid, I think it'll more constructive to convince you that it does.
lets first take a look at a definition:

>#### institutional racism  
>noun  
>UK  /Àå…™n.st…™Àåt ÉuÀê. É…ôn.…ôl Ààre…™.s…™.z…ôm/ US  /Àå…™n.st…ôÀåtuÀê. É…ôn.…ôl Ààre…™.s…™.z…ôm/  
>policies, rules, practices, etc. that are a usual part of the way an organization works, and that result in and support a continued unfair advantage to some people and unfair or harmful treatment of others based on race  [^1]

Seems simple enough. Any org. in which one race (e.g. whites) have an unfair advantage over another (e.g. blacks) counts as posessing institutional racism.

#### what institutional racism does NOT mean:
- only a white's problem
- that _everyone_ in the institution is racist
- that _anyone_ in the institution is openly or otherwise consciously racist

Lets explore some org.s that fit that definition...

### Evidence for systematic racism in the Met police
The last independent review of the Met Police's internal culture stated[^2]:
1. Clearly not everyone in the Met is racist, but there are racists and people with racist attitudes within the organisation
2. Black and ethnic minority officers and staff experience racism at work and it is routinely ignored, dismissed, or not spoken about. Many do not think it is worth reporting
3. Racism and racial bias are reinforced within Met systems
4. The Met under-protects and over-polices Black Londoners  
> "We have found institutional racism, misogyny and homophobia in the Met." - Baroness Casey of blahblah 

_üò¨ pretty damming huh?_ feels more like it ought to be from 1960 not 2023.

ik that you will maybe not-believe this report, despite it being written by someone who _knowsMoreThanYou<sup>TM</sup>_, so here are some more examples:
- murder of stephen lawrence (the key report of which only came out only 10 yrs before obama took office)[^3]
- murder of Jean Charles de Menezes (brazillian) in 2005 (only 4 years before obama took office)[^3]
- 2019 child strip search statistics[^3]
  -  75% of strip searches from ethinically diverse backgrounds
  -  *75%* is **NOT** acceptable, whatever you may say about black crime
  -  Is it not horrifying that (based of ethnicicty) I am 3/4s more likely to be strip searched than you?
- murder of Chris Kaba (a black man shot by the police in **2022**)[^3]
  - and yet this kinda thing is a "thing of the past???"
  - this isn't even going into american politics, this happend a **fucking** **30 mile drive away from us**, is that not in the least concerning?
- during the pandemic black ppl were **217% as likely** as white ppl to be issued a fine for lockdown breaches? [^3]
  - this statistic holds up even when adjusted for neighbourhood composition
- within the police, black officeres describe being treated _"like animals"_ and that the racism was **getting worse** [^4]
  - so much for things are always much better rn eh?

the funny thing is i previously thought police racism was a USA-centic issue, that atleast in the UK police were OK, welp nope.  
ik it's worse in the US but _surely_ you must agree that racism does **exist** within our law enforcement, _surely_ you must see that **all** the **independant** reports commisioned by the gov. agree with this conclusion. To deny this would _surely_ be to deny what's a universally seen upon truth by all who have competent reasoning skills. Im not sayign you don't have competent reasoning skills, im just saying ppl who deny this shit, claim it doesn't exist etc. are either:
1. naive
2. dumb
3. racist

### UK Prisons
- if you're not white and commit a crime, it is a fact that you are more likely to go to jail than if you were
  - 50% of youth immates are minorities [^5]
    - **%50 percent**, i doubt 50% of crimes are committed by minorities given we make up 14% of the population
    - how is this not insititutional racism???
    
### UK Healthcare
- Asian women are 2x as likely to die in pregnancy [^5]
- Black women are 2x as likely to have a stillborn baby than white women [^5]
How on earth is that acceptable
Yes there are physical differences between races in terms of the ease of pregancy, but:
1) not enough to account for a fucking 2x increase.
2) even if there were significant differences, doctors in the uk should learn better how to treat different races,
    - this IS possible given other countries where uk minorities are the majority have similar success rates to the uk

### In the education system
yes the *goddam education sytem*, the **last place we want racism**
- is it not _slightly_ sobering that black students are far more likely to recieve **under predicted grades** by their teachers [^5]
- is this not the **ultimate** damming evidence of institutional racism???,  
i mean jesus christ if black kids are given a 2nd class education from the start, how **tf** can we expect them to perform equally as adults on shit like IQ tests?

### Income inequality
- If you're black and you have the same degree as a white person, you will on average end up with 27.1% less income [^5]
- **How** is that not evidence for prevelant institutional racism?
  - ‚ÄºÔ∏èmaybe allah isn't all that akbar after all eh‚ÄºÔ∏è

I could keep going, list private companies, heck I haven't even started on America, but i think that there is enough evidence infront of you for any sane man to make the correct jugdment

### conclusion 1
- if some races are **set up to fail** by the very institutions setup to help us, the institutions that we all rely upon to govern, teach, police and treat, is it not surprising that obamam might want to discuss this???
- do you not see how naive and cynical it is to spit out shit like "obama's rhetoric was deeply [racially] divisive", I struggle to believe that you would even for a second seriously consider obama for running on some racially inflamatory agenda.
- this will be adressed in the obama section below

>I think a similar reason to you in that I think the arguments for a social explanation have little substance logically speaking (racism = lower IQ, why?

>...I think it's [genetics] the simpler, less convoluted explanation and that it would be more appealing if people didn't have to tread so carefully on this topic

>Fine, jfc, I'll just agree that I think it's more likely than not it [genetics] significantly explains it [IQ gap between races]

<summary>Opinion 5: <h2>Obama racist </h2></summary>

>"Obama ran in 2008 as the great unifier but in 2012 appealed much more to the more left wing base and to minorities. His rhetoric was deeply divisive and presided over race riots like Ferguson (after Michael Brown) and Baltimore"

>"The fact is, race relations were really pretty good before Obama started going on about system racism and we had blm and stuff"  

This one troubles me.  
How can you look at Obama, the first black president of the USA, and see him as a cause of racism?  
Did racism increase during his tenure?, sure maybe?  
Was that because of Obama, or because of Obama's skin colour?  
People (including Trump pbuh) became racist and virile towards Obama. Was that because of Obama, or because Obama, by the very nature of being Black brought out the pre-existing racism already prevelant throughout the country?  


### wait but the graphs, the graphs...
- Correlation ‚â† causation Callum.
- Obama helped draw racism into the spotlight, largely due to all the increased racism directed **at him** (e.g. birther conspriacy theorists)
- so how would an incrased knowledge and understanding of racism, especially the much more subtle aspects of it, affect your graphs?
- exactly, they'd _appear_ as if racism was getting worse after obama when in reality all that happened was people started too understand the full extent of it all.

### wait but the riots, the riots...
IDK how riots occuring under Obama is supposed to imply Obama chose to cause racial division, i.e. that somehow it was Obama's fault.
- Yes Obama may have been the cause, ppl in the nation not ready for his truths on racism might've felt need to draw imaginary lines along skin tones
- Yes because of this increased tension racial division might've increased
- Yes because ppl felt both empowered by having a Black POTUS and outraged by the increased hate, riots happened
- Yes riots are bad.

BUT the primary cause of the riots WAS NOT:
- Obama
- the average black person
- the average white person

It was **racism**  
this shouldn't be hard to understand ü•ï, just bc Obama talked about racism, and made racists angry does **not** mean that obama was in the wrong. The ppl that were angry (and in this case the rioters who chose to violently counter the racists) are in the wrong. 

### Conclusion:
- You are claiming Obama's rhetoric was "deeply divisive" only based off the end reaction. The problem here was not the rhetoric, but that divided reaction.
- **We should _not_ look at racial riots and come to the conclusion that racism should be swept under the carpet.**
  - And as I'm sure you're aware, these riots riots only happened when a large peacful protest was disrupted by a minority of violent thugs.
  - People were protesting the increase in racism they saw. That this increase in racial tensions coincided with the first black POTUS don't surpise me, ppl are generally resistive to change. But long term i _hope_ u would believe Obama has done alot to help stamp racism out.

## 5. Asian work ethic ‚â† reason for high IQ scores
>I would argue in this case it's because of their incredibly strong work ethic/culture around work, especially at school- and I don't see that as an unfair stereotype, as Daniel, who has lived in east asia, would testify it is true. It is not hard to see how this would increse IQ
>
> (in response) I also question the extent to which IQ can be increased this way - Callum
