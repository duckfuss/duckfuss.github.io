# Callum we need to talk

I'm genuinely concerned  
Here are some of your opinons, debunked

> [!CAUTION]
> - No offence, but remember that you have no experience with racism
> - This clearly does not put you in the best position to discuss this topic - for whilst you ofc can discuss it freely, you just lack any _personal_ experience (which counts for something imo)


## White ppl aren't very racist
>“Whites *by far* have the least in group out group bias”

## Systematic racism doesn't exist
> "The fact is, race relations were really pretty good before Obama started going on about system racism and we had blm and stuff"  

Really?, _really_?, __*really*__??  
You really believe this **crap**???   

By _"system racism"_ i assume you mean systematic/institutional racism - how on earth is it a bad thing to bring systematic racism into the limelight?  

### ...so you think systematic racism doesn't exist?  
Rather than list of reasons why you are absolutely and utterly stupid, I think it'll more constructive to convince you that it does.
lets first take a look at a definition:
>#### institutional racism  
>noun  
>UK  /ˌɪn.stɪˌtʃuː.ʃən.əl ˈreɪ.sɪ.zəm/ US  /ˌɪn.stəˌtuː.ʃən.əl ˈreɪ.sɪ.zəm/  
>policies, rules, practices, etc. that are a usual part of the way an organization works, and that result in and support a continued unfair advantage to some people and unfair or harmful treatment of others based on race  [^1]






## BLM bad bc riots or smthn
> "The fact is, race relations were really pretty good before Obama started going on about system racism and we had blm and stuff"


## Black ppl genetically dumber
>I think a similar reason to you in that I think the arguments for a social explanation have little substance logically speaking (racism = lower IQ, why? Seems mainly to be an emotional response) and whilst the data is far from conclusive, when looking at the fact that richer black people have similar iq to poorer whites and that the racial iq gap has not significantly changed, I don't see reasons to believe it's societal
>
>...I think it's [genetics] the simpler, less convoluted explanation and that it would be more appealing if people didn't have to tread so carefully on this topic

>Fine, jfc, I'll just agree that I think it's more likely than not it [genetics] significantly explains it [IQ gap between races]

## Asian work ethic ≠ reason for high IQ scores
>I would argue in this case it's because of their incredibly strong work ethic/culture around work, especially at school- and I don't see that as an unfair stereotype, as Daniel, who has lived in east asia, would testify it is true. It is not hard to see how this would increse IQ - Henry (who is correct)
>
>I also question the extent to which IQ can be increased this way - Callum
