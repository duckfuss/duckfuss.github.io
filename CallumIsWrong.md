# Callumü•ï, we need to talk

I'm genuinely concerned, **please, please, please read this in its entirety!!!**  


> ### ‚ö†Ô∏è  Important:
> - I do **not** believe you are a racist, however I do believe you are severely misguided and hold, in spite of your better intentions, some views I would class as such.
>     -  nobody is calling u a racist, nobody is saying all white people are racist. It's ofc tough when some of your race has historically been so racist, but this is not a reflection upon you, nor anyone else.
>     -  **BUT** it is _wrong_ to try counteract the efforts of us now to try deal with the after-effects of white supremacy. Ideas don't just disapear, so **how the fucking fuck** is educating ppl about diversity and inclusion a "bad" thing?
> - No offence, but remember that you have no personal experience with racism
>   - when someone chooses to pick on you, or decides they dislike you, it has likely never been bc of your race
>   - you've never had someone pass you in a corridor and whisper or yell a slur at you
>   - there is something particularly degrading about being picked on _for no other reason than your skin colour_ that you will likely **never** understand
> - Whilst you ofc can discuss it freely, you just lack any _personal_ experience (which does count for something imo)
>   - This is not to discourage debate or discussion....

Here are some of your opinons, largely (still WIP) debunked...

<details>
<summary> Opinion 1: <h2>1. Institutional racism... </h2></summary>

> "The fact is, race relations were really pretty good before Obama started going on about system racism and we had blm and stuff"  

Really?, _really_?, __*really*__??  
You really believe this **crap**???   

By _"system racism"_ i assume you mean systematic/institutional racism - how on earth is it a bad thing to bring institutional racism into the limelight??  

### ...so you think institutional racism doesn't exist?  
Rather than list of reasons why you are absolutely and utterly stupid, I think it'll more constructive to convince you that it does.
lets first take a look at a definition:

>#### institutional racism  
>noun  
>UK  /Àå…™n.st…™Àåt ÉuÀê. É…ôn.…ôl Ààre…™.s…™.z…ôm/ US  /Àå…™n.st…ôÀåtuÀê. É…ôn.…ôl Ààre…™.s…™.z…ôm/  
>policies, rules, practices, etc. that are a usual part of the way an organization works, and that result in and support a continued unfair advantage to some people and unfair or harmful treatment of others based on race  [^1]

Seems simple enough. Any org. in which one race (e.g. whites) have an unfair advantage over another (e.g. blacks) counts as posessing institutional racism.

#### what institutional racism does NOT mean:
- only a white's problem
- that _everyone_ in the institution is racist
- that _anyone_ in the institution is openly or otherwise consciously racist

Lets explore some org.s that fit that definition...

### Evidence for systematic racism in the Met police
The last independent review of the Met Police's internal culture stated[^2]:
1. Clearly not everyone in the Met is racist, but there are racists and people with racist attitudes within the organisation
2. Black and ethnic minority officers and staff experience racism at work and it is routinely ignored, dismissed, or not spoken about. Many do not think it is worth reporting
3. Racism and racial bias are reinforced within Met systems
4. The Met under-protects and over-polices Black Londoners  
> "We have found institutional racism, misogyny and homophobia in the Met." - Baroness Casey of blahblah 

_üò¨ pretty damming huh?_ feels more like it ought to be from 1960 not 2023.

ik that you will maybe not-believe this report, despite it being written by someone who _knowsMoreThanYou<sup>TM</sup>_, so here are some more examples:
- murder of stephen lawrence (the key report of which only came out only 10 yrs before obama took office)[^3]
- murder of Jean Charles de Menezes (brazillian) in 2005 (only 4 years before obama took office)[^3]
- 2019 child strip search statistics[^3]
  -  75% of strip searches from ethinically diverse backgrounds
  -  *75%* is **NOT** acceptable, whatever you may say about black crime
  -  Is it not horrifying that (based of ethnicicty) I am 3/4s more likely to be strip searched than you?
- murder of Chris Kaba (a black man shot by the police in **2022**)[^3]
  - and yet this kinda thing is a "thing of the past???"
  - this isn't even going into american politics, this happend a **fucking** **30 mile drive away from us**, is that not in the least concerning?
- during the pandemic black ppl were **217% as likely** as white ppl to be issued a fine for lockdown breaches? [^3]
  - this statistic holds up even when adjusted for neighbourhood composition
- within the police, black officeres describe being treated _"like animals"_ and that the racism was **getting worse** [^4]
  - so much for things are always much better rn eh?

the funny thing is i previously thought police racism was a USA-centic issue, that atleast in the UK police were OK, welp nope.  
ik it's worse in the US but _surely_ you must agree that racism does **exist** within our law enforcement, _surely_ you must see that **all** the **independant** reports commisioned by the gov. agree with this conclusion. To deny this would _surely_ be to deny what's a universally seen upon truth by all who have competent reasoning skills. Im not sayign you don't have competent reasoning skills, im just saying ppl who deny this shit, claim it doesn't exist etc. are either:
1. naive
2. dumb
3. racist

### UK Prisons
- if you're not white and commit a crime, it is a fact that you are more likely to go to jail than if you were
  - 50% of youth immates are minorities [^5]
    - **%50 percent**, i doubt 50% of crimes are committed by minorities given we make up 14% of the population
    - how is this not insititutional racism???
    
### UK Healthcare
- Asian women are 2x as likely to die in pregnancy [^5]
- Black women are 2x as likely to have a stillborn baby than white women [^5]
How on earth is that acceptable
Yes there are physical differences between races in terms of the ease of pregancy, but:
1) not enough to account for a fucking 2x increase.
2) even if there were significant differences, doctors in the uk should learn better how to treat different races,
    - this IS possible given other countries where uk minorities are the majority have similar success rates to the uk

### In the education system
yes the *goddam education sytem*, the **last place we want racism**
- is it not _slightly_ sobering that black students are far more likely to recieve **under predicted grades** by their teachers [^5]
- is this not the **ultimate** damming evidence of institutional racism???,  
i mean jesus christ if black kids are given a 2nd class education from the start, how **tf** can we expect them to perform equally as adults on shit like IQ tests?

### Income inequality
- If you're black and you have the same degree as a white person, you will on average end up with 27.1% less income [^5]
- **How** is that not evidence for prevelant institutional racism?
  - ‚ÄºÔ∏èmaybe allah isn't all that akbar after all eh‚ÄºÔ∏è

I could keep going, list private companies, heck I haven't even started on America, but i think that there is enough evidence infront of you for any sane man to make the correct jugdment

### conclusion
- if some races are **set up to fail** by the very institutions setup to help us, the institutions that we all rely upon to govern, teach, police and treat, is it not surprising that obama might want to discuss this???
- do you not see how naive and cynical it is to spit out shit like "obama's rhetoric was deeply [racially] divisive", I struggle to believe that you would even for a second seriously consider obama for running on some racially inflamatory agenda.
- this will be adressed in the obama section below

<summary>Opinion 2: <h2> 2. White ppl aren't infact very racist towards others ü•¥ </h2></summary>
  
>‚ÄúWhites *by far* have the least in group out group bias‚Äù

now this one is really quite pathetic for a few reasons:
1. It simply isn't a universally agreed upon fact (as implied by the wording "by *far*") [^6]
	1. I for example think that it is wrong
2. *Even* if it were true, the disparity between races some white's have historically subjugated (and currently racially target) and white's in-group favouritism is, imo, clearly caused by that abuse.
3. It carries the **strong** insinuation that white's aren't racist, or white's are somehow the least racist. which is _**wrong***_
	1. don't even for a second dare claim this isn't the case or you were unaware of this insinuation - don't patronise me pls.

### 2.1 is that really so true?
- Stop üõë., Stop scrolling **twat**ter for one damn second.
	- pause and think, is that really true, or is the dude waffling at me through my youtube echo chamber a little biased and maybe presenting the facts differently?
	- remember **you can find evidence for _anything_**, from the moon landings were faked to cell towers cause COVID.
- There is plenty of evidence showing white's as having the most in group out group bias [^6] so I strongly dispute that assertion, and even then the margins are quite small
	- 50% of whites favour will actively (but subconsciously) favour whites over asians; 42% of asians favour asians over asians. [^6]
		- 50%!!!, now you may claim the number is a bit lower, but it must surely still be **significant**
		- how is that ok???
	- In times of crises, why are black labourers both paid and employed less?, racism?, in group favouritism?[^7]
- Ik you won't care to see my evidence bc u obv prefer yours, but my hope is that by showing you evidence **against** you point exists, you will understand that the literature isn't so cut and dry, and that maybe your position isn't so definite.
	- Don't let ur **hubris** prevent yourself from seeing objectively

so you still don't believe me?, well...
### 2.2 If it were true, does it matter?:
- So what?, white ppl feel less desire to hate others. I think what this really shows is how much white ppl currently, but *subconsciously* so they don't believe it happens, discriminate against other races.
- Parents of minorities have to bring up their children to be wary of racism, to be aware of it, and to try counter it. This simply isn't always the case in white households, for it does not pose a direct issue to white ppl (in the uk)
	- Thus I would argue white people are less aware of racism, and thus less likely to want to stick together
- When you are a minority, the feeling of "needing to stick together" with ppl "like you" is exacerbated, there is no need for white ppl to stick together in the uk, but there is a level of protection, and easier communication when between those with similar minority cultural backgrounds.
	- hence why communities like "little India" and "Chinatown" form [^8]
- And when the majority race is white, I would argue any racism matters more in a utilitarian sense, it has a worse average impact of your racist and white, bc on average you are in a greater position of power.

### 2.3 Racism and white people
oof what a large subject, I will only touch on this, but it's worth mentioning because:
1. You would only have made that assertion ("whites have ... out-group bias") had you believed that racism was no longer that big an issue. (don't try deny this Callum, i'm not stupid)
2. You would only have made that assertion had you perhaps felt *threatened* or *accused* of as being racist. - this one I kinda get, but to try be some anti-woke sheeple is the **wrong** response
Lets try address the first point:
1. racism **is** a big issue - even I, in sheltered North Ascot have experienced it (once in your fucking presence tooüì£)
2. Minorities (primarily black ppl tbh) are often targets of unacceptable levels of institutional racism (question: what is an acceptable level for you?) and subconscious bias.
	- oh yeah, forgot you didn't believe in subconscious bias. We've been there before but if u push the point I can write up another crap essay on the topic to try save ur ass.
3. Blatant racism is ofc less than it used to be, but is **still prevalent**, and still **bad**
4. Here I will make an argument you dislike, but I see as true:

   Hi callum, This paragraph may not sound familiar eh?, well ask any minority and you'd struggle to find someone who has not experienced racism. Just because Callum ü•ï hasn't doesn't mean we haven't. ok? So don't go round telling us we're wrong to say that racism still very much exists.
now for the second - in fact imma put this in it's own section up top.

<summary>Opinion 3: <h2> 3. BLM bad bc riots or smthn</h2></summary>

> "The fact is, race relations were really pretty good before Obama started going on about system racism and we had blm and stuff"

### rage against the (facist) machine ü§¨
Now i'm beyond anger, and into just sheer confusion. The idea that before BLM, race relations were "really pretty good" is showing **stratospheric levels of naivety**, ignorance that exists beyond the Oort cloud. If you had claimed Jesus was a moose named **Jeffery Dahmer** I would still posses a higher level confidence in your ability to **think thoughts**. If you told me that lampshades cause bowel cancer in earthworms I would still consider your opinion an opinion. However I do _not_ consider your claim to be anything but a *startlingly dangerous falsehood* from what is supposedly a rather clever brain. We both know how the internet likes to distort the truth, how it allows **absofuckingidiots** to portray themselves and their cult as mainstream and acceptable. Racism is a cancer, _please_ tell me you're *not* **chain-smoking this crap.**

But who am I kidding, humorous metaphors do fuck all to convince someone they're wrong, so lemme try another angle.

### lets first define what "really pretty good" race relations ISN'T
- Here's a questionnaire for you, is the racially motivated murder of innocent black men by police:
	1) good race relations
	2) *pretty* good race relations
	3) **really** *pretty* good race relations
- Woah trick question, bet you didn't see that coming eh.
- Turns out it's neither. A society where police will randomly murder ppl of a specific race on a whim (in quite a brutal fashion) is NOT "really pretty good"
	- things might've been "really pretty good" for those unaware of the extent of these racism problems. But I'm sure for ppl living under it things really fucking weren't really pretty good.
- There are clearly multiple issues with a society where:
	- police feel that they can get away with shit like this
	- police feel it's ok to do shit like this
	- police hire ppl like you (jk-ish)
- If the very ppl we are supposed to report racism to, are **overflowing** with it, how tf do you expect the problem to even **start** going away?
	- ooh good questionüôã, should we:
		1. wait till society somehow changes on it's own?
		2. deny the problem ever existed?
		3. engage in peaceful protest and force ppl to listen?
	- I hope you agree that of these options, no.3 is best, or at least no.3 is an option many people would choose, and one that should improve circumstances
### when the racially motivated murder of black ppl by cops leads to a peaceful protest
- So people decided to protest huh. This wasn't just because of one single crime, but rather the collective venting of deep ingrained racism in the police forces and beyond
- I'm sure you'd agree protest is counterintuitively a sign of thriving democracy, that people can peacefully exercise that right is paramount, whether you agree with them or not. 
  *(obv within limits etc. but I'm sure you have no problem with protest in this context)*
- I would also *hope* you would agree with people protesting racism. 
	- (Racism bad and prevalent ‚à¥ ***Anti*-racism** protest **good** and **necessary** no?)
- I would also hope that by now you don't believe race relations were "really pretty good", or at least you can observe the sheer number of people who deemed race relations really not good enough that they were motivated to dedicate their free time towards organising and/or attending protests
	- nobody is walking down roads for the hell of it eh, ppl feel a need to address and bring racism into the open.

### when a small section of a peaceful protest becomes a very small riot
- I think you'd struggle to disagree that *peaceful* protest = good, and that anti-racism protest = good
- So why *why* ***WHY*** is it so hard to understand that rioters do **not** represent the protesters???
	- 96% of demonstrations were peaceful and resulted in no property damage [^9][^10]
	- Compare this with 89% during the civil right's movement. - which were nearly 3x more violent. [^11]
- wait so the protest weren't that violent after all huh?
	- but what was it my favourite convicted sexual abuser[^12] said? 
		- oh wait he's a dipshit who serves only to fuel racial divisions.
		- still boggles my mind u, ü•ïü§°, can view Obama as fuelling racial divisions but Trump[^12] as a successful all round ok guy
		- this leads quite nicely into....

### when a small riot becomes a right wing media stratophenomenon
- so a **not so big** riot meets your not so smart "journalist" who's only objective is to farm impressions on his article over the internet - what happens?
- then a not so smart friend reads that piece of "journalism" - what happens?
I hope you get what i'm getting at here Callum.
### when a media stratophenomenon starts fuelling racial division
well here we are eh, I would thus **strongly** argue that, with you, Callum, as a prime example, that what has caused the increase in racial tensions was not BLM, but the **polarising** media's portrayal of it. After all we live in an economy where polarisation = money & votes. Don't be so daft to view an *incredibly* peaceful anti racism protest as the cause of this polarisation. It was the stupid fucking snakes that seek to use small news about small riots to further their own selfish racist means. As I said earlier, racism is a cancer, _please_ tell me you're *not* **chain-smoking this crap.**

<summary>Opinion 4: <h2>4. Obama racist </h2></summary>

>"Obama ran in 2008 as the great unifier but in 2012 appealed much more to the more left wing base and to minorities. His rhetoric was deeply divisive and presided over race riots like Ferguson (after Michael Brown) and Baltimore"

>"The fact is, race relations were really pretty good before Obama started going on about system racism and we had blm and stuff"  

This one troubles me.  
How can you look at Obama, the first black president of the USA, and see him as a cause of racism?  
Did racism increase during his tenure?, sure maybe?  
Was that because of Obama, or because of Obama's skin colour?  
People (including Trump pbuh) became racist and virile towards Obama. Was that because of Obama, or because Obama, by the very nature of being Black brought out the pre-existing racism already prevelant throughout the country?  


### wait but the graphs, the graphs...
- Correlation ‚â† causation Callum.
- Obama helped draw racism into the spotlight, largely due to all the increased racism directed **at him** (e.g. birther conspriacy theorists)
- so how would an incrased knowledge and understanding of racism, especially the much more subtle aspects of it, affect your graphs?
- exactly, they'd _appear_ as if racism was getting worse after obama when in reality all that happened was people started too understand the full extent of it all.

### wait but the riots, the riots...
IDK how riots occuring under Obama is supposed to imply Obama chose to cause racial division, i.e. that somehow it was Obama's fault.
- Yes Obama may have been the cause, ppl in the nation not ready for his truths on racism might've felt need to draw imaginary lines along skin tones
- Yes because of this increased tension racial division might've increased
- Yes because ppl felt both empowered by having a Black POTUS and outraged by the increased hate, riots happened
- Yes riots are bad.

BUT the primary cause of the riots WAS NOT:
- Obama
- the average black person
- the average white person

It was **racism**  
this shouldn't be hard to understand ü•ï, just bc Obama talked about racism, and made racists angry does **not** mean that obama was in the wrong. The ppl that were angry (and in this case the rioters who chose to violently counter the racists) are in the wrong. 

### Conclusion:
- firstly just wow, how is Obama more divisive than that convivted sexual abuser you so adore [^12]
- You are claiming Obama's rhetoric was "deeply divisive" only based off the end reaction. The problem here was not the rhetoric, but that divided reaction.
- **We should _not_ look at racial riots and come to the conclusion that racism should be swept under the carpet.**
  - And as I'm sure you're aware, these riots riots only happened when a large peacful protest was disrupted by a minority of violent thugs.
  - People were protesting the increase in racism they saw. That this increase in racial tensions coincided with the first black POTUS don't surpise me, ppl are generally resistive to change. But long term i _hope_ u would believe Obama has done alot to help stamp racism out.

<summary>Opinion 5: <h2> 5. Black ppl genetically dumber</h2></summary>

>I think a similar reason to you in that I think the arguments for a social explanation have little substance logically speaking (racism = lower IQ, why? Seems mainly to be an emotional response) and whilst the data is far from conclusive, when looking at the fact that richer black people have similar iq to poorer whites and that the racial iq gap has not significantly changed, I don't see reasons to believe it's societal
>
>...I think it's [genetics] the simpler, less convoluted explanation and that it would be more appealing if people didn't have to tread so carefully on this topic

>Fine, jfc, I'll just agree that I think it's more likely than not it [genetics] significantly explains it [IQ gap between races]
